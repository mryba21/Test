## API Key Setup

To use the Edamam food database API, you need to obtain an API key and application ID:

1. Sign up for an API key and application ID at the [Edamam Developer Portal](https://developer.edamam.com/).
2. Create a file named `api_keys.py` in the project directory and add your API key and application ID in the following format:
> [!IMPORTANT]
> An API key file is required to return results from the application.

 ```python
  EDAMAM_APP_ID = 'your_app_id_here'
  EDAMAM_APP_KEY = 'your_api_key_here'
``` 
4. Save the file.

## Installation

To install and run the Food Log Application, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
 ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/jocelyngilbertson/foodlogapp.git
 ``` 
2. Navigate to the project directory:
 ```bash
    cd foodlogapp
 ``` 
3. Install the required dependencies using the file ```Package Installation.py``` or 
 ```python
  import subprocess
  import sys
   
  def install(package):
      subprocess.check_call([sys.executable, "-m", "pip", "install", package])
   
  # Install packages
  install("opencv-python")
  install("pyzbar")
  install("requests")
  install ("ttkbootstrap")
``` 
## Usage

To run the application, execute the following command:

```bash
python run_TkInter.py
``` 

## Main Application

The main application logic is contained within the `run_TkInter.py` file. Below is an overview of its structure and key components:

### `run_TkInter.py`

This is the entry point of the application. It initializes the TkInter GUI and handles user interactions. The key components include:

-   **Initialization**: Sets up the main window and its properties.
-   **Widgets**: Defines and places widgets such as labels, entry fields, buttons, and listboxes.
-   **Event Handling**: Contains functions to handle events like button clicks and listbox selections.
-   **Data Management**: Includes functions to manage food log entries, such as adding, editing, and deleting entries.

```python
# Example snippet from run_TkInter.py
import tkinter as tk
from tkinter import messagebox

def main():
    root = tk.Tk()
    app = FoodLogApp(root)
    root.mainloop()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
